        2. Skin off all 3 html files, then link them to the css file.
        3. See what kinds of elements are in html files(p,headers,etc).
        4. Use Dream weaver to add a p, headers(h1,h2,h3,h4,h5),html,body,pre and hr in css.
        5. Create a fold called images to store the background image.
